Sergeant Woolyknickers, the world's last known grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), was found dead by Yellowstone Park rangers at the confluence of Yellowstone River and Thorofare Creek. The sentimental explanation for his demise is heartbreak: his mate, Elvira, was felled by a viral infection a few months prior. <br><br>DNA samples were taken from both bears during their stay at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo in 2050, but efforts to clone them have proven unsuccessful. Zookeepers reintroduced the pair into the wild several months ago in hopes that a large outdoor territory would encourage them to produce cubs.<br><br>Conservation efforts at the turn of the century met with some success in restoring the bears; in 2017, the species was delisted as endangered by the United States Interior Department.

In the park's heyday, more than 100,000 visitors each month passed below this arch on their way to visit such celebrated landmarks as the geyser \"Old Faithful,\" the mighty Yellowstone River, and the vibrant Grand Prismatic Pools.&#160;<br><br>Since President Ulysses S. Grant signed an Act of Dedication to create Yellowstone National Park in 1872, it has survived forest fires, world wars, and earthquakes to be enjoyed by nature-lovers for more than 150 years, until environmental concerns drove the world into chaos.&#160;<br><br>In 2031, the federal government withdrew funding from the park and transferred ownership to the State of Wyoming, after which the rate of visitation slowed to a trickle. Old Faithful's dependable eruptions went unobserved, and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, where guests once devoured bison meatballs, sat empty for years, blankly staring across an expanse of wilderness.&#160;<br><br>The '30s saw several attempts to privatize the park. Many companies, including the powerful Faro Automated Solutions, made bids to purchase its land. After Faro's proposal was abruptly withdrawn in 2040, weakened federal protections on public parks were restored, coinciding with the easing of climate change through technical means.&#160;<br><br>As the world claws back, so too will Yellowstone. As of next week, the part will be restored to the United States government, with Faro Automated Solutions returning to finance the handoff, as well as providing funding for as-yet-unspecified new facilities.
