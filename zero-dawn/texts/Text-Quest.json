Born and raised outside of Carson City, she enrolled at Stanford University at age 13, earning a BS in Experimental Physics and Computer Science at age 16. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Design at Carnegie-Mellon University in 2040 and joined Faro Automated Solutions as a Junior Scientist the same year, rising quickly to Chief Scientist at age of 22. Over the next eight years, her green robot designs played a vital role in realizing the environmental cleanup and detoxification efforts of \"The Claw-back\" decade, propelling FAS to the forefront of its field. In 2048, she suddenly resigned from FAS, protesting the company's pivot to automated military technologies. In 2049, she founded Miriam Technologies, a firm devoted to \"life-positive\" robotics and other technologies. Miriam has since become one of the world's largest suppliers of green robots, winning numerous awards and accolades, including the 2053 Nobel Prize for Physics and the 2056 Rachel Carson Award for Environmental Progress.<br><br>", "Theodor \"Ted\" Faro (born December 24, 2013) is an American entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder of Faro Automated Solutions (FAS), the largest corporation of all time, the world's wealthiest individual, and the first-ever trillionare. Born and raised in Salt Lake City, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles where he studied business for two years before dropping out in 2033 to start FAS. Though it struggled at first, the company broke through at the end of the troubled 2030s with its popular lines of personal servitors and bodyguard bots, then exploded when its famous line of green robots led the race to solve the climate crisis during the 2040s \"Claw-back.\" At the end of that decade, FAS opened a military defense branch, dominating the world market for automated military platforms by 2053. The success of FAS has made Mr. Faro the world's best-known businessman, one of its most sought-after speakers, and a major voice in politics, culture, and international affairs.<br><br>", "Faro Automated Solutions (FAS) is an American multinational corporate entity that produces robots for all walks of life, though its core business consists of military and defense contracts. As of 2063, FAS has ranked #1 among the Fortune 5 by gross revenue and profit for ten years in a row, a world record. Founded in 2033 by Theodor \"Ted\" Faro, an entrepreneur from Salt Lake City, Utah, the company developed several promising robot prototypes in its early years but failed to break into markets dominated by then-industry giants like General Synthetics and RECorp. This changed in 2038 with the debut of the @lfred line of levitating personal servitors, which generated exceptional sales, lifting the company onto the Fortune 50 for the first time. Profits tripled in the 2040s as the company's environmental efforts, led by famed engineer Elisabet Sobeck, catapulted FAS to the head of that sector. In 2049, in the wake of the successful green and climate cleanup efforts around the globe, worldwide approval ratings of FAS exceeded 90% and founder Ted Faro was hailed across media and social networks as \"the man who saved the world.\" Yet it was the emergence of FAS as a military contractor in the late 2040s that cemented its status as the world's wealthiest corporation, with a record market capitalization of over $23 trillion. By 2055, FAS controlled 61% of the market share for automated military platforms, holding contracts with 353 nations, trans-governmental organizations, and corporate entities. Today, its holdings exceed the second largest corporation (FBMobiHal Global) by 321%.<br><br>", "Corporation (noun)<br>\\k\u022fr-p\u0259-r\u0101-sh\u0259n\\<br>An association of individuals, created under authority of law, having existence, powers, and liabilities distinct from those of its members.

Most corporations engage in one or more industries to produce goods or offer services for profit, and may in turn own other corporations, companies, or property as holdings.<br><br>", "Reception Log: July 7, 2064<br><br>9:54 AM<br>Field Commandant Daing of the Indo-Malay Agricultural Combine arrived with his delegation.

Living spaces for Alphas already completed - prefab modules. Fingers crossed we never have to seal ourselves in here... not that Elysium sounds much better.<br><br>Spent last week at the Bryce site, designing ZD project labs, drawing up protocols. The base we're repurposing was huge - plenty of room for work spaces and residence blocks. The work crews already set up my office/lab. I'm not a fan of the glass wall. Guess Murray's intention was to ensconce me as \"all-seeing presence.\" Ugh. Opposite effect. Makes me feel watched, on display.

Expect Mk1 will take two weeks to machine, assemble, and test. I aim to launch GAIA at 0.6T grounding. From there I'll spin her up past 1.0T. Wonder how long it'll take to break the 1.38T record. MIE can go hang.<br><br>Sleep.<br><br>", "Last time I visited Prime was November of last year. Months since have been a blur. Flew out last night to oversee installation of the central armature and the master override (you're welcome, Ted) which was completed by 0430. So I decided to grab a few hours of sleep here before heading back to ZD. Called GAIA before I bedded down, ostensibly to update her on the site plan. But the truth is, I missed her. I've developed a habit of speaking to her before I sleep. Seems to be the only thing that calms me down these days.<br><br>Woke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial's life chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What's to stop them from playing god?<br><br>Forwarded the Odyssey message to the Alphas. Naoto replied in less than a minute - with a poem, of course. \"The Building of the Ship\" by Longfellow - and it's loooong, all right. I didn't read all of it, but it seems to be about launching a ship, rather than building one. This stanza (or couplet, or whatever) leapt out at me:<br><br>Humanity, with all its fears,<br>With all its hopes of future years,<br>Is hanging breathless on thy fate!<br><br>Yeah, Odyssey and Zero Dawn both. Speaking of which, I should get back to ZD. Guess I should stop by Naoto's lab and check on DEMETER's progress, too. If I can get out of there without a volume of Tennyson pressed into my hands, I'll count myself lucky.<br><br>'Til next time.<br><br>", "Halloween.<br><br>Travis came by trick-or-treating - dressed up like me. Should've seen that coming. I gave him a half-eaten packet of dandy wafers as a \"treat\" and kicked him out... but not before he invited me to some kind of \"Italian horror extravaganza\" he organized for ZD staff. Seriously. As though there isn't enough horror in the world already.<br><br>Anyway, I was already scheduled to fly out here to G Prime for final inspections with Herres and the President's delegation. Ted was here, too, and he was not looking good. Kept fidgeting and couldn't seem to look me in the face without blinking. I was relived when he boarded his vert and flew back to \"Thebes\" (gag). Though I guess I shouldn't complain... if he wants to build himself a \"deluxe shelter\" to ride out the apocalypse, let him. Keeps him out of Elysium and away from me.<br><br>Herres stuck around long enough to give me a detailed briefing on the strategic situation. Basically, we've entered the terminal phase. (As though the color of the sky when I was flying over here wasn't clue enough.) Another two or three weeks, and the atmosphere won't be breathable. The last vestiges of the European and West-African civ brigades are trapped with their backs against the Atlantic. The swarm that scuttled across Antarctica is crossing the straits of Magellan, about to start its death crawl up South America towards the Amazon. (All the work we did to reconstitute the rain forest... and it comes to this.) And advance elements of the Pacific swarms are already skirmishing with units on the Cal-Mar seawall.<br><br>The noose is tightening. Projections show we can still finish in time, but the margin of error is +/- 10 days - not a good spread. If the plague breaks through ahead of schedule... Well, it just can't.

Felt like I was going to throw up. But they already knew, of course. They knew the work wasn't really finished. Close, but not quite there. Still tests to run, kinks to smooth- work to do. So they accepted it. No Elysium for us. We'll spend the rest of our lives here, testing and polishing each subordinate function to perfection.<br><br>Guess that's what you get when you recruit a bunch of obsessive perfectionists. Managed not to cry until I got back to my office.<br><br>So here we are, setting up GAIA Prime. And yeah, such a close thing. Makes me feel nauseated all over again when I contemplate how the fate of life could hinge on coincidence. If I'd never proposed the Lightkeeper protocol, there never would have been living spaces constructed here. If I'd abandoned the protocol sooner, the necessary life support systems never would have been installed. IF, IF, IF. At least we won't have to endure the creepiness of raising and training clones of ourselves. The genetic material was never processed out of the cradle sites, so it's not even possible. For which I'm glad. I really, really, wouldn't want to spend time around a young Travis Tate raised by Travis Tate. No, it'll be up to us to perfect GAIA, one generation only.<br><br>Update: That was General Herres. The salient has collapsed.
