At some point the holo welcomed me to the \"dam family.\" And I felt like A.) that was such a missed opportunity, because they could have called it a \"damily\" and chose not to, and B.) the idea that I would ever think of any of my coworkers as \"family\" was pretty ridiculous.<br>But then, one day, I looked up, and automation had whittled six people down to just Laura and I, and I was signing papers to dissolve the family I thought I had. And suddenly my last coworker, with her faded tattoos and perpetually arched eyebrows, was telling me jokes, and making me listen to bands I'd never heard of, and cheering me up when I cried.<br>Things were really good when it was just the two of us. We used to have these theme days. One time, the sluice gates were open, and we set up beach blankets on one of the catwalks in the intake tower and batted around this inflatable beach ball I had in my apartment for some reason. Laura messed around with the emergency PA and patched in a bunch of classical surf rock songs. We even put sunscreen on the bridges of our noses.

Laura!<br>MESSAGE TEXT:<br>Dear Nobody,<br>I feel embarrassed now, thinking about following Laura out of the pump station like a kicked puppy, wondering what horrible thing I might have done, until she threw herself into this room and shut the door behind her and just screamed. The fear of abandonment is weirdly self-centered. Because it pre-supposes that little-old-you are filled with such immense destructive power that you're capable of driving every person you care about away.<br>Anyway, at the bottom of the dam, with her on side of the door and me on the other, she told me that Metallurgic had bought her mom's house\u2014her  whole neighborhood, in fact\u2014out from under her to build a new server farm.<br>\"Ugh, god, I don't even like that house,\" she said. \"I don't even like Indianapolis. I hated every minute I spent in that city as a kid. When they told us we'd have to leave the dam, I went back to my apartment, and sat on my bed, and I prayed to a god I don't even believe in that I wouldn't have to move back home, that I wouldn't have to show up on my mom's front stoop with a suitcase and a bunch of stupid excuses. \"She was trying not to sound like she was crying. But she sounded like she was crying. \"I guess I got my stupid wish, huh?\"<br>I asked her where she'd go, and she laughed. Where else could she go? Back home, to help her mom pack up the house, to move with her into whatever dank little one-room hole Metallurgic's \"displacement grant\" will allow them to afford. \"I think I could have dealt with being one of those losers who celebrate their fortieth birthday living in the house they grew up in. But now? Now I don't even have that.\"<br>I had no idea how to make her feel better. So I just sat on the other side of the door, and I started singing the song we were working on. The one about being the last two girls on earth.

We could practice in holospace.<br><b>SHELLY:</b> People always say that.<br>MESSAGE TEXT:<br>Dear Nobody,<br>We got in a fight. Laura and I. After practice, we went out for drinks. There's this Robar in downtown Cody, so we called an autocar and shuttled over. We were the only people there. With the park closing, Cody's becoming a ghost town.<br>The more we drank, the more passive-aggressive our banter became, snowballing out of our control, metastasizing in the empty air between us, and then before either of us really knew what was happening, we were yelling at each other. I kept thinking, like, I'm not abandoning her, she's abandoning me. And I guess she was probably thinking something similar.<br>We got quiet for a while. Drank more. Eventually Laura ordered an autocar, and we piled into it, slid as far from each other on the back seat as we could, arms crossed, staring out the window. And then I heard myself talking. \"Screw it. I don't care if you stay in touch with me. I'm going to stay in touch with you. Whether you like it or not, you're not getting rid of me. Ever.\"<br>Laura looked at me for what felt like ages. I thought she was going to start yelling. But then her hand crept over mine, and we just sat there together.<br>Bottoms up,<br>Shelly <br>","<b>DOD BLEVINS:</b> I didn't ask for a bunch of flying cameras. I need security, not surveillance.
